# Traffic Sign Image Classification

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for classifying traffic signs using a customized CNN sequential model. The repository includes the dataset and code structured as follows:

1. **Download and Imports**: Download necessary libraries and import required modules.
2. **Functions**: Define helper functions for data processing and model evaluation.
3. **Loading Dataset (Traffic Signs Images)**: Load the traffic signs dataset.
4. **Data Splitting and Conversion**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets and preprocess the images.
5. **Creating and Compiling the Model**: Define and compile the customized CNN model.
6. **Training the Model**: Train the CNN model on the training dataset.
7. **Visualizing the Performance of the Model during Training Phase**: Visualize the training and validation performance.
8. **Loading Test Dataset and Evaluating the Model**: Load the test dataset and evaluate the model's performance.
